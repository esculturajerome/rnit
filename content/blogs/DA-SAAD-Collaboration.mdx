The Romblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) and the Department of Agriculture’s Special Area for Agricultural Development (DA-SAAD) joined forces to provide meat processing capabilities within the San Jose Swine Raisers’ Association. A dedicated allocation of funds enabled an initiative to foster the skills of local swine raisers in making skinless longganisa and tocino.

RNIT played a key role in the training by providing a qualified food processing trainer and the necessary tools and equipment for the training sessions. Ms. Ma. Dianne Lu L. Galicia, Assistant Professor III, with the support of representatives from DA-SAAD headed by Jercel Catubig, Community Development Officer, facilitated the training which was held from April 11 to 12, 2024 at the Covered Court in Poblacion, San Jose, Romblon. The commitment to this training program was evident by the presence of key stakeholders including San Jose Municipal Agriculturist, Felipe T. Malacad, Overall President of Associations, and Officer-in-Charge Mayor at both the opening and closing ceremonies.

This project, led by DA-SAAD, aims to promote prosperity within the San Jose Swine Raisers’ Association by diversifying income streams for local swine raisers through enhanced meat processing skills.

The collaboration between RNIT and DA-SAAD exemplifies a shared commitment to community development and economic empowerment, leveraging expertise and resources to uplift local communities and foster sustainable growth in Romblon.
