The Romblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) recently focused on boosting the writing skills of its faculty and staff, particularly in crafting research proposals. Their goal wasn't just to teach skills but to fix problems in Research and Development (R&D) applications, which had been a challenge for RNIT.

After careful planning, the institution organized a special training entitled, **"Writeshop Training in Research and Development."** It ran for five intense days, every Friday, to accommodate everyone's schedules. It started on February 16 and ended on March 15. The training aimed to help participants improve their writing abilities.

Ms. Ma. Dianne Lu L. Galicia, the Research Focal Person, and Assistant Professor III, together with Ms. Anna Christina C. Martinez, the Vocational School Administrator II, led the training. They brought in **Mr. Juniel G. Lucidos**, an Associate Professor V at Romblon State University San Andres Campus, who is experienced in research.

The training began on February 16 with a kickoff event attended by 24 participants, including 19 from teaching roles and 5 from administration. Acting Provincial Director Engr. Lynette M. Gatarin also attended. The speaker introduced the National TVET Research Agenda (NTRA) Research Proposal Form, a crucial template for TESDA submissions. Participants engaged in practical exercises like the "Problem Tree Analysis" to identify research gaps.

As the training continued, participants learned about the Review of Related Literature on February 23, laying the groundwork for the study's background, objectives, and its impact on TVET. On March 01, they discussed Methodology, emphasizing its importance in research. On March 08, the training focused on crafting the conceptual framework, a key aspect of strong research proposals.

The training ended on March 15 with sessions on creating Work Plans and Budgets that followed TESDA guidelines closely. During the closing ceremony, participants received their certificates of completion, and a certificate of commendation was given to the resource speaker in recognition of his expertise.

Professor Juniel offered ongoing support for refining proposals, ensuring participants were ready to submit their research outputs to the NTRA for potential funding. Mr. Prenz Jumer B. Lota, Officer-in-Charge/Vocational Instruction Supervisor I, expressed gratitude for the successful training, marking a significant step towards research excellence at RNIT.
