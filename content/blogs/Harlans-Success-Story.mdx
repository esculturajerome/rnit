## From Dreams to Reality 🌟

Harlan Madrilejos, an OFW in Taiwan, turned his dreams into reality after completing **Shielded Metal Arc Welding NC II - 2013** at RNIT. His training empowered him to work abroad, support his family, and build his own home.

"Dahil sa TESDA SMAW NC II training, natupad ko ang pangarap ko—makapagtrabaho abroad, matulungan ang pamilya, at magkaroon ng sariling bahay. Sa sipag, tiyaga, at pananampalataya, lahat ay posible!"
