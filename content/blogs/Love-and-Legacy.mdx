Formerly known as Alcantara National Trade School (ANTS), the Romblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) celebrated a trifold event this February. These were its 54th Founding Anniversary, Induction Program, and Valentine's Day Program, with the theme "A Symphony of Love and Legacy".

For Part I of the program, everyone was welcomed by RNIT’s Officer-in-Charge, Anna Christina C. Martinez. She commemorated the foundation of the institution and appreciated the collective efforts and dedication of all those who contributed to achieve this significant milestone.

On behalf of Engr. Lynette M. Gatarin, Acting Provincial Director of TESDA Romblon, Rochelle M. Zulueta, TESD Specialist II, reflected on the true meaning and significance of the day, that while traditionally associated with romantic love, the essence of the day extends beyond romantic relationships, encompassing all forms of love and appreciation.

Mayor Riza G. Pamorada of Alcantara expressed her gratitude for the significant contributions of RNIT, not only to the lives of the Alcantarahons, but also to all Romblomanons, impacting the overall development of the province. She inducted into their respective offices the newly elected Supreme Student Council (SSC) officers.

In her inspiring talk, retired Professor Elna L. Baldea shared her life story. She started as a teacher in this institution then the Alcantara National Trade School. Over the years, she worked her way up to becoming the Officer-in-Charge of RNIT and eventually retired as an Assistant Professor IV. Along this journey, she found her true love, Mr. Gerald Baldea, who was also a teacher at the school. She emphasized the importance of love, stating that actions driven by love lead to beautiful outcomes for everyone.

Princess Clee G. Ferrer and Clark M. Gonzales graced the gathering with their
soulful voices, serenading everyone present.

Assistant Professor I and SSC Adviser Prenz Jumer B. Lota thanked everyone who contributed to making the event a big success.

As an organ associated with love, a symposium on caring for the heart was facilitated by Ma. Melody G. Galicia, Nurse II, providing valuable insights into heart health and wellness. As a preventive measure against heart disease, everyone participated in a 15-minute Zumba dance session.

Following all the activities mentioned, a “Love Feast” took place, where special meals were shared by the attendees, symbolizing unity, togetherness, and the spirit of love that bind the RNIT community.

The SSC Officers, along with trainees from Automotive Servicing NC I, Diploma in Mechanical Engineering Technology, and Electrical Installation and Maintenance NC II, celebrated Valentine’s Day with various activities, including the Love Confession Booth, a space where attendees could express their feelings to their loved ones; Photo Booth, a place where attendees could capture memories of the event, Jail Booth, a playful booth where attendees could “imprison” their friends for a laugh, Wedding Booth, a fun-filled booth where attendees could experience a mock wedding, and a Movie Booth:, a cozy spot where attendees could watch romantic movies.

After the Valentine's Day celebration, the faculty and staff proceeded to attend the Ash Wednesday Mass. During the Mass, they offered some produce from the RNIT Farm and baked products.
