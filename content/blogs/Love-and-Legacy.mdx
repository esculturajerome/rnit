Formerly known as Alcantara National Trade School (ANTS), the Romblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) celebrated a trifold event this February: its **54th Founding Anniversary**, **Induction Program**, and **Valentine's Day Program**, all under the theme "A Symphony of Love and Legacy".

## Part I: Commemoration and Reflection

The program began with a warm welcome from **Anna Christina C. Martinez**, RNIT’s Officer-in-Charge. She commemorated the institution's foundation and acknowledged the collective efforts that led to this significant milestone.

Representing Engr. Lynette M. Gatarin (Acting Provincial Director, TESDA Romblon), **Rochelle M. Zulueta** (TESD Specialist II) reflected on the day's significance, emphasizing that its essence extends beyond romantic relationships to encompass all forms of love and appreciation.

**Mayor Riza G. Pamorada** of Alcantara expressed gratitude for RNIT's contributions to the province and inducted the newly elected Supreme Student Council (SSC) officers.
