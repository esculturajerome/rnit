Atty. Eleandro Jesus F. Madrona serving the Lone District of Romblon led the distribution of Starter Toolkits with TESDA Romblon Acting Provincial Director Engr. Lynette M. Gatarin and Romblon National Institute of Technology Vocational School Administrator II Anna Christina C. Martinez. The initiative aimed at empowering graduates in Bread and Pastry Production NC II, Driving NC II, Plant Crops Leading to Agricultural Crops Production NC II, and Service Electrical System Leading to Motorcycle/Small Engine Servicing NC II. A total of 209 TESDA graduates hailing from Alcantara, Looc, San Jose, and Santa Maria municipalities were beneficiaries of the toolkit distribution, following their completion of training in 2023.

Congressman Madrona, who funded the training through the scholarship Special Training for Employment Program (STEP), emphasized the hands-on nature of TESDA training, highlighting its distinction from traditional high school and college education. He underscored TESDA's dedication to facilitating job placements for its graduates post-training, stressing its practical approach to skill development and employment. Messages were delivered by Municipal Mayors: Hon. Lorilie M. Fabon of Santa Maria, Dr. Riza G. Pamorada of Alcantara, and Atty. Lisette M. Arboleda of Looc, along with members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Romblon: Hon. Natalio Beltran III, Hon. Herminio Mortel, Hon. Rubelyn Solis and Hon. Venizar Maravilla.
