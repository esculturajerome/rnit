In supporting the 2024 National Women’s Month Celebration, Romblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) conducted a three-day program aimed at honoring and celebrating the significant contributions and achievements of women in society.

The theme for this year's celebration, “Lipunang Patas sa Bagong Pilipinas: Kakayahan ng Kababaihan, Patutunayan!” acknowledges the indispensable role women play in shaping a fair and progressive society.

The planned series of events commenced with a symbolic gesture of solidarity. Under the administration of Vocational School Administrator II Anna Christina C. Martinez, RNIT's faculty and staff donned purple attire every Friday, symbolizing their support for gender equality. With the supervision of Ms. Madonna Abegail G. Matre, Instructor I, RNIT faculty transplanted tomato and pechay seedlings, showing that the institution is committed to nurturing growth and empowerment within the community.

The celebration was highlighted by the provision of training sessions tailored specifically for women, facilitated by female trainers.
The festivities kick-offed with a two-day training session led by Ms. Madonna Abegail G. Matre, focusing on the production of Fermented Plant Juice and Fermented Fruit Juice, which was attended by 16 female farmers from Barangay Poblacion. Simultaneously, an instructional course on Pastry Making, overseen by Ms. Melanis Baldea, Instructor III, was participated by eight senior citizens. Furthermore, Ms. Ma. Dianne Lu L. Galicia provided training in Calamansi Processing and Pickles Making for the Special Needs Education (SNED) students of Alcantara National High School. RNIT employees provided assistance and support to the training participants throughout the duration of the program.

A symposium followed afterward, featuring Ms. Carolyn D. Fetalver, the Gender and Development (GAD) Director of Romblon State University, as the keynote speaker, highlighting women as pillars of strength that leave a lasting impact and shape the course of history. Vocational Instruction Supervisor I, Prenz Jumer B. Lota, underscored the invaluable contributions of Filipino women to society and expressed his gratitude to all involved in the success of the event. In behalf of TESDA Romblon Acting Provincial Director, Engr. Lynette M, Gatarin, Yolly Fortunato, Administrative Officer V, graced the event with her presence. Certificates of Training were conferred upon the training participants. SNED Teacher I, Jenifer G. Lilang, of Alcantara National High School, expressed eagerness for future collaborations with RNIT TESDA, as her students found the session enjoyable and as they are aspiring for employment post-graduation. Honorable Gil O. Solidum, Jr., Barangay Captain of Poblacion, extended appreciation to RNIT for the provided training, recognizing its potential to generate income and benefit his constituents.

Concluding the program, RNIT's Gender and Development (GAD) Focal Person, Teresa F. Galicia, expressed heartfelt gratitude to all participants for their active involvement in acknowledging and honoring the invaluable contributions of Filipino women to our society.

In essence, Romblon National Institute of Technology's efforts in organizing this three-day affair stands as a testament to its unwavering dedication to championing gender equality and advancing the rights and welfare of women, thereby fostering a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
