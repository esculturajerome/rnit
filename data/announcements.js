      <p>Romblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) started the day with a Mass officiated by Rev. Fr. Ethelbert F. Magbata, February 17. Rev. Terence F. Fabicon reminded everyone to trust the process as we all have our crosses to carry and we have to endure them to make us stronger.</p> <br/>
      
      <p>The opening program started with the Officer-in-Charge, Anna Christina C. Martinez, warmly welcoming the attendees. She thanked the retirees for their unfaltering love for the institution, TESDA Romblon and PTC Romblon for always supporting RNIT in each and every endeavour. Teary eyed, she thanked Joysedyll M. Fajutnao, Vocational Instruction Supervisor I, Human Resource Designate and Planning Focal for a job well done through the four-day event.
      Richard Rose, trainee in the 3 year Diploma Program in Mechanical Engineering Technology serenaded everyone with his beautiful voice. </p> <br/>
      <p>Dra. Riza G. Pamorada, Mayor of the Municipality of Alcantara warmed our hearts with her hopeful words of inspiration.
      The Provincial Director of TESDA Romblon, Engr. Amir M. Ampao gave his ever unfaltering commitment to serve the province through technical education and training.
      Certificates of Appreciation and Tokens were given to the speakers as well as those who made the event possible: Felipe S. Gado (Assistant Professor III) , Melanis Baldea (Instructor I), Ma. Dianne Lu L. Galicia (Instructor I) and Prenz Jumer B. Lota (Instructor I).</p> <br/>
      <p>Certificates of Training and tokens were also awarded to the employees, retirees and stakeholders who attended the Skills Development Training.</p> <br/>
      
      <p>The climax of the event is the walk in the past wherein all the retirees reminisced their time as a personnel in the institution. Some may be not as good, but most of their time here was the fruitful and the happiest. With their efforts and hard work in the past lies the foundation of the present and the continuous evolvement in the future.
      A sumptuous feast followed.</p> <br/>
      
      <p>To top off the 53rd Founding Anniversary, RNIT faculty, staff and trainees were able to know more about the heart and mental health awareness. Municipal Health Officer Dr. Jobin G. Maestro, PHASE, together with seven (7) medical student observers from Child Family Health International Global Health Internship Program from Chicago, Kentucky and Kansas Medical Schools discussed about hypertension, its signs and symptoms, causes and risk factors and what to do to avoid contracting this silent killer disease. They also taught about a way to meditate to clear anxiety and to engage to casual conversations, exercise and eat healthy whenever feeling down.</p> <br/>
      
      <p>The event was a success with the outstanding teamwork and dedication of the RNIT Family.</p>`,
